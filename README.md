This repo contains my personal notes, exercises and projects from working through 
**_Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Kerass and TensorFlow_** by Aurelien Geron 

The goal of this repo is to:
- Improve my understanding on core ML concepts 
- Practice implementation of models 
- Document insights and helpful tips I learn along the way
